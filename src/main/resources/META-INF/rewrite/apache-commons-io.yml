displayName: Relocate `org.apache.commons:commons-io` to `commons-io:commons-io`
description: |
  The deployment of `org.apache.commons:commons-io` [was a publishing mistake around 2012](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/MVNCENTRAL-244)
  which was corrected by changing the deployment GAV to be located under `commons-io:commons-io`.
