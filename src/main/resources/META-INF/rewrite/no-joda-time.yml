displayName: Prefer the Java standard library instead of Joda-Time
description: >-
  Before Java 8, Java lacked a robust date and time library, leading to the widespread use of Joda-Time to fill this
  gap. With the release of Java 8, the `java.time` package was introduced, incorporating most of Joda-Time's concepts.
  Features deemed too specialized or bulky for `java.time` were included in the ThreeTen-Extra library.  This recipe
  migrates Joda-Time types to `java.time` and `threeten-extra` types.
